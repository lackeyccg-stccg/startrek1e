RELEASE INFORMATION

NEW:
- This release changes the complete layout of the data files; columns were dropped and others added. The old column layout was 
  Name	Set	ImageFile	Rarity	Release	Info	Type	Affil	Class	Int/Rng	Cun/Wpn	Str/Shd	Points	Region	Span	Icons	Staff	Species	Persona	Command	Reports	Text the new one is
  Name	Set	ImageFile	Release	Info	Property	Printable	Uniqueness	Type	Mission/ Dilemma Type	Affil	Class	Int/Rng	Cun/Wpn	Str/Shd	Points	Region	Quadrant	Span	Icons	Staff	Characteristics/ Keywords	Requires	Persona	Command	Reports	Text
  Rarity was dropped as well as Species, Property, Printable, Uniqueness, Mission/Dilemma Type, Quadrant, Characteristics/Keywords, Requires were added. The new layout far more resembles the 2e layout.
- "% " denoting universal ships and personnel was dropped from the name (as well as the "# " for Enigma personnel); this information is now incooperated in the Uniqueness column.
- All card info is now concurrent with the trekcc info (Nov 2012); only the "Duras-related personnel" information was added by hand. E.g. search for "ENGINEER-related" equipment, "murder-related" dilemma or "capture-related" card is now possible.
- All information on free reports ("Reports" column) was added by hand. Vital information might be missing though. Available are 
	Augment Research Facility
	Camp Khitomer
	Central Command
	Chamber of Ministers
	Continuing Committee
	Deep Space Station K7

- Instead of three files (first, virtual and second) we now use two files (Physical.txt and Virtual.txt).
- All 2E BC cards which are already converted are deleted from the files.
- The uninstall.txt should clear most of the superfluous images.
-  Additional information is available in the texts; card references are enclosed in curly brackets {}, icon references in square brackets [], downloads are denoted by a DL/.
- All icons are encoded like on the trekcc site:
	(G>, <G) ...	Nemesis Icons (G - Green, K - Black, L - Blue, S - Silver, Y - Yellow, R - Red)

- The distinction between Universal and Unique cards is now available only for personnel; only the universal cards are marked (for easier search).
- All cards are sorted lexicographically in the info column (by using appropriate trailing zeroes)
- All hail Maelwys!!!

UPDATES:
- TNG, TNGSup, Engage, HF3 sets are added.

KNOWN ISSUES: 
- Pack files do not work properly; we have to wait for a fix from lackeyccg.com
- Draft mode is not included at the moment.
- Lackey does not recognize umlauts and entities outside ASCII 127, so some information may be missing or miss-spelled.

DIFFERENCES TO TREKCC:
- All following cards have a name different from the name at trekcc.org. For the sake of  unique names we have added either the set name (Vovager), (The Borg), (Homefront), (Identity Crisis), (Homefront II), (Homefront III), (The Next Generation), or the release type (Virtual Promo), or - in two cases AP to denote alternative images. So when trying to convert between trekcc.org and lackey these names have to be accounted for!
